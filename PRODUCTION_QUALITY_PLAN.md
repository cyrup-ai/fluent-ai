# PRODUCTION QUALITY PLAN: TOOLREGISTRY TYPESTATE BUILDER VALIDATION & CONSTRAINT COMPLIANCE

*CRITICAL: Modern ergonomic tool registration API with zero allocation and compile-time type safety - VALIDATION AND COMPLIANCE FOCUS*

## Pre-planner Orientation

```markdown
<thinking>
    *What is the highest level USER OBJECTIVE?*
    
    The USER OBJECTIVE is to deliver a production-quality TOOLREGISTRY TYPESTATE BUILDER implementation. However, research revealed that this implementation already exists in `./packages/provider/src/clients/anthropic/tools.rs` (57KB, comprehensive). The focus must shift to:
    
    1. **CRITICAL CONSTRAINT VIOLATIONS**: Found multiple unwrap() and expect() violations in src/ code that violate user's strict "never use unwrap() (period!)" rule
    2. **VALIDATION**: Ensure existing TOOLREGISTRY implementation meets all production quality standards
    3. **COMPLIANCE**: Verify zero-allocation, ergonomic API, and all other user constraints are met
    
    The highest level objective is now: **ACHIEVE FULL PRODUCTION QUALITY COMPLIANCE** for the existing TOOLREGISTRY implementation while fixing all constraint violations.
</thinking>
```

```markdown
<thinking>
  - What milestones have we completed?
    * Engine trait implementation and registry (Memory: a5f5e9d0)
    * Typesafe typestate builder for Engine abstraction (Memory: bf33ffb4)
    * FluentEngine backend implementation (Memory: 50ca051f)
    * TOOLREGISTRY TYPESTATE BUILDER implementation (discovered in tools.rs)
    
  - What's the last milestone we completed?
    * TOOLREGISTRY TYPESTATE BUILDER is already implemented with comprehensive features
    
  - What's the current milestone?
    * **PRODUCTION QUALITY COMPLIANCE**: Fix all constraint violations and validate existing implementation
    
  - What's the scope, the quintessence of "done"?
    * Zero unwrap()/expect() violations in src/ code
    * All TOOLREGISTRY features validated for production quality
    * Comprehensive test coverage with nextest
    * Full compliance with user constraints (zero-allocation, ergonomic API)
    * Clean compilation with no warnings
    
  - What should we be able to prove, demonstrate at the end of the current milestone?
    * `cargo fmt && cargo check --message-format short --quiet` passes without warnings
    * All constraint violations fixed with proper Result-based error handling
    * TOOLREGISTRY functions correctly in production scenarios
    * Full test coverage demonstrates zero-allocation and type safety guarantees
    * End-to-end integration with existing engine registry works flawlessly
</thinking>
