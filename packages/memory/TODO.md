# TODO: Memory Package Performance Optimization

## Critical Performance Tasks for 10/10 Blazing-Fast Performance

### 1. CRITICAL: Fix unwrap/expect violations in migration/converter.rs

### 9. MEDIUM: Fix mod relaxed_counter reference in mod.rs
Remove the 'mod relaxed_counter;' declaration on line 69 since RelaxedCounter is now defined inline in vector/in_memory_async.rs. This is causing a compilation warning or error.

Act as an Objective QA Rust developer and verify that the memory package achieves the stated 10/10 blazing-fast performance goals. Confirm all constraints are met: zero allocation, no unsafe code, no locking, no unwrap/expect, elegant ergonomic code.

## Performance Constraints

- **Zero allocation**: Use ArrayVec, SmallVec, atomic operations
- **Blazing-fast**: SIMD optimization, lock-free data structures
- **No unsafe code**: All operations must be memory-safe
- **No locking**: Complete lock-free concurrent programming
- **Never use unwrap() or expect()** in src/ code
- **Elegant ergonomic code**: Clean, readable, maintainable patterns

## NEVER use unwrap() or expect() in src/ code (period!)
## DO USE expect() in ./tests/* 
## DO NOT use unwrap() in ./tests/*

All tasks must be completed with these constraints in mind. No exceptions.
