//! Comprehensive macro system types for automated chat operations
//!
//! This module provides a complete type system for recording, storing, and replaying
//! chat interactions as macros. It supports complex automation scenarios including
//! conditional execution, loops, variable substitution, and resource management.
//!
//! # Core Concepts
//!
//! - **Recording**: Capture user actions and commands into replayable sequences
//! - **Playback**: Execute recorded macros with variable substitution and control flow
//! - **Variables**: Dynamic content replacement during macro execution
//! - **Conditions**: Conditional logic for branching macro behavior
//! - **Loops**: Iterative execution patterns with configurable repetition
//! - **Resource Limits**: Safety constraints for memory, CPU, and I/O usage
//!
//! # Performance Characteristics
//!
//! - **Lock-free queues**: Uses `SegQueue` for high-performance action storage
//! - **Thread-safe counters**: Atomic execution statistics tracking
//! - **Zero-allocation patterns**: Minimal heap allocations during execution
//! - **Efficient cloning**: Smart cloning strategies for complex data structures
//!
//! # Safety Features
//!
//! - **Resource limits**: Configurable bounds on memory, CPU, and I/O usage
//! - **Timeout protection**: Automatic termination of long-running macros
//! - **Error isolation**: Failed actions don't crash the entire macro system
//! - **Recursion limits**: Protection against infinite recursion scenarios
//!
//! # Usage Patterns
//!
//! ```rust
//! use fluent_ai_candle::types::candle_chat::macros::types::*;
//!
//! // Create and record a macro
//! let metadata = MacroMetadata::new("test-macro");
//! let mut session = MacroRecordingSession::new("test".to_string(), metadata);
//! session.start_recording();
//! session.add_action(MacroAction::SendMessage {
//!     content: "Hello, world!".to_string(),
//!     message_type: "text".to_string(),
//!     timestamp: Duration::from_millis(100),
//! });
//! session.stop_recording();
//!
//! // Convert to macro and execute
//! let chat_macro = session.to_macro();
//! let mut playback = MacroPlaybackSession::new(chat_macro.metadata.id, chat_macro.actions.len());
//! playback.start_playback();
//! ```

/// Atomic macro action representing a single recorded operation
///
/// MacroAction defines the fundamental building blocks of chat macros, representing
/// discrete operations that can be recorded during user interactions and replayed
/// during macro execution. Each action includes timing information for accurate
/// reproduction of user behavior patterns.
///
/// # Action Types
///
/// - **SendMessage**: Text communication with type classification
/// - **ExecuteCommand**: Command execution with full command context
/// - **Wait**: Timing delays for natural interaction pacing
/// - **SetVariable**: Dynamic variable assignment during execution
/// - **Conditional**: Branching logic with optional else clauses
/// - **Loop**: Iterative execution with configurable repetition counts
///
/// # Serialization
///
/// All actions support JSON serialization for persistent macro storage and
/// cross-session compatibility. The format is optimized for both human
/// readability and efficient parsing.
///
/// # Performance Considerations
///
/// - **Memory efficient**: Uses `Arc<str>` for shared string data
/// - **Clone optimized**: Efficient cloning for macro duplication
/// - **Timestamp precision**: Duration-based timing for microsecond accuracy
/// - **Nested structures**: Recursive action support for complex control flow
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```rust
/// use std::time::Duration;
/// use fluent_ai_candle::types::candle_chat::macros::types::MacroAction;
///
/// // Simple message action
/// let message = MacroAction::SendMessage {
///     content: "Hello, AI!".to_string(),
///     message_type: "greeting".to_string(),
///     timestamp: Duration::from_millis(500),
/// };
///
/// // Variable assignment
/// let var_action = MacroAction::SetVariable {
///     name: "user_name".to_string(),
///     value: "Alice".to_string(),
///     timestamp: Duration::from_millis(1000),
/// };
///
/// // Conditional execution
/// let conditional = MacroAction::Conditional {
///     condition: "user_name == 'Alice'".to_string(),
///     then_actions: vec![message],
///     else_actions: None,
///     timestamp: Duration::from_millis(1500),
