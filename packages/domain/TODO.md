# Domain Crate Arc Elimination & Streaming Architecture Rewrite

## Objective
Systematically eliminate ALL Arc usage and implement streaming-only, zero-allocation, lock-free, immutable architecture across all domain modules, prioritized by Arc usage count.

## Architecture Constraints
- **Streaming-only**: No Future patterns, use AsyncStream and channels exclusively
- **Zero-allocation**: Eliminate all Arc, use borrowed data and atomic operations
- **Lock-free**: Replace all locks with atomic operations and immutable structures
- **Immutable messaging**: All message/event structures must be immutable after creation
- **No unsafe/unchecked**: Production-safe code only
- **No unwrap/expect**: Proper error handling throughout
- **No stubs/mocks**: Complete, functional implementations only
