# `http3`

`http3` is a pure Rust, allocation optimizedHTTP/3 (QUIC) client with HTTP/2 fallback with ergonomic, high-level builders reminiscent of axium and fuel in other languages.

[`http3`](https://github.com/cyrup-ai/fluent-ai/packages/http3) uses [`fluent_ai_async`](https://github.com/cyrup-ai/fluent-ai/packages/async-stream), built over the efficient, thread-safe primitizes in crossbeam for low-allocation, common streaming uses cases.
