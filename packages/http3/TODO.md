# TODO List for fluent_ai_http3

## Errors
1. **Error in builder_test.rs (Line 22)** - Mismatched types: Expected `serde_json::Value`, found `Vec<_>` when using `HttpStreamExt::collect(stream)`. [Completed]
2. **QA for Error in builder_test.rs (Line 22)** - Act as an Objective Rust Expert and rate the quality of the fix on a scale of 1 - 10. Provide specific feedback on any issues or truly great work.
   - Rating: 9/10. The fix correctly handles the stream collection by concatenating chunks and deserializing to JSON. It might be worth checking if there's a more efficient way to handle large streams without concatenation.
3. **Error in builder_test.rs (Line 52)** - Mismatched types: Expected `serde_json::Value`, found `Vec<_>` when using `HttpStreamExt::collect(stream)`. [Completed]
4. **QA for Error in builder_test.rs (Line 52)** - Act as an Objective Rust Expert and rate the quality of the fix on a scale of 1 - 10. Provide specific feedback on any issues or truly great work.
   - Rating: 9/10. Similar to the previous fix, it's effective but could potentially be optimized for memory usage with very large responses.

## Warnings
5. **Warning in middleware_cache_tests.rs (Line 52)** - Variable `headers` does not need to be mutable. [Completed]
6. **QA for Warning in middleware_cache_tests.rs (Line 52)** - Act as an Objective Rust Expert and rate the quality of the fix on a scale of 1 - 10. Provide specific feedback on any issues or truly great work.
