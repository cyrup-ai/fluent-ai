## Architecture Notes

- **Zero Allocation**: All streaming operations use fluent_ai_async patterns with const-generic capacity
- **Lock-Free**: No mutexes or locks, only crossbeam primitives for concurrency
- **Elegant Ergonomics**: Builder patterns and method chaining for intuitive API
- **Error Handling**: Error-as-data pattern with MessageChunk trait, no Result<T,E> in streams
- **Performance**: Strategic inlining, zero-copy operations where possible
- **Safety**: No unsafe code, proper trait bounds and type constraints
