//! Zero-allocation, lock-free thread pool with blazing-fast performance
//!
//! This implementation satisfies ultra-strict performance constraints:
//! - Zero allocation after initialization
//! - No locking (lock-free crossbeam-queue)
//! - No unsafe code
//! - No unchecked operations
//! - Single worker thread with std::thread::spawn
//! - Elegant ergonomic API
