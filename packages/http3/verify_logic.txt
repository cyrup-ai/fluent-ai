DESCENDANT SEGMENT LOGIC VERIFICATION
====================================

JSON Structure:
{
  "store": {              // Depth 1 - store object
    "book": [             // Depth 2 - book array  
      {"author": "Author 1"},  // Depth 3 - book1 object
      {"author": "Author 2"}   // Depth 3 - book2 object
    ]
  }
}

RFC 9535 Section 2.5.2.2: "The descendant segment applies the child segment to every node at every depth"

For $..[?@.author]:
- .. = descendant segment
- [?@.author] = child segment (filter for nodes with 'author' property)

Apply [?@.author] to every node:

Depth 1: store object
- Has 'author' property? NO
- Match: NO

Depth 2: book array  
- Has 'author' property? NO
- Match: NO

Depth 3: book1 object
- Has 'author' property? YES ({"author": "Author 1"})
- Match: YES

Depth 3: book2 object  
- Has 'author' property? YES ({"author": "Author 2"})
- Match: YES

EXPECTED RESULT: Exactly 2 matches
- book1 object: {"author": "Author 1"}
- book2 object: {"author": "Author 2"}

PREVIOUS INCORRECT BEHAVIOR: 5 results
- 1 incorrect match (book array)
- 2 correct matches (book objects)  
- 2 duplicates (same book objects again)

NEW IMPLEMENTATION:
apply_descendant_segment_recursive() applies child selectors to current node,
then recursively applies to all children. This should eliminate duplicates
and ensure correct RFC 9535 compliance.
