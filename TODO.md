## üéØ PRIORITY: AgentConfig Elimination and Architectural Corrections

### MILESTONE 5: Complete AgentConfig Elimination and Architectural Correction

65. **CRITICAL**: Eliminate AgentConfig from domain/src/agent.rs
    - **File**: `packages/domain/src/agent.rs`
    - **Lines**: 239:17
    - **Implementation**: Replace `config: Arc<AgentConfig>` with `role: Arc<dyn AgentRole>`
    - **Architecture**: AgentBuilder should use AgentRole (the prototype interface) instead of unauthorized AgentConfig. This maintains clean separation where AgentRole defines behavior contracts and Agent implements the concrete system.
    - DO NOT MOCK, FABRICATE, FAKE or SIMULATE ANY OPERATION or DATA. Make ONLY THE MINIMAL, SURGICAL CHANGES required.

66. **QA-34**: Act as an Objective QA Rust developer and rate the work performed on AgentConfig elimination in domain package. Verify: (1) No AgentConfig references remain in agent.rs, (2) AgentBuilder properly uses Arc<dyn AgentRole>, (3) All related imports updated correctly, (4) Code compiles without AgentConfig errors. Rate 1-10 with specific feedback.

67. **CRITICAL**: Delete AgentConfig struct from fluent-ai engine module
    - **File**: `packages/fluent-ai/src/engine/mod.rs`
    - **Lines**: 22

    - DO NOT MOCK, FABRICATE, FAKE or SIMULATE ANY OPERATION or DATA. Make ONLY THE MINIMAL, SURGICAL CHANGES required.

68. **QA-35**: Act as an Objective QA Rust developer and rate the work performed on AgentConfig struct deletion. Verify: (1) AgentConfig struct completely removed from mod.rs, (2) No compilation errors from missing struct, (3) Module exports updated appropriately, (4) Clean module structure maintained. Rate 1-10 with specific feedback.

69. **CRITICAL**: Replace AgentConfig with AgentRole in fluent_engine.rs
    - **File**: `packages/fluent-ai/src/engine/fluent_engine.rs`
    - **Lines**: 3, 73, 77
    - **Implementation**: 
      - Line 3: Update import to remove AgentConfig, add AgentRole if needed
      - Line 73: Replace `config: AgentConfig` with `role: Arc<dyn AgentRole>`
      - Line 77: Replace `pub fn new(config: AgentConfig)` with `pub fn new(role: Arc<dyn AgentRole>)`
    - **Architecture**: FluentEngine should accept AgentRole trait objects for configuration, maintaining proper separation between role definition (AgentRole) and engine implementation.
    - DO NOT MOCK, FABRICATE, FAKE or SIMULATE ANY OPERATION or DATA. Make ONLY THE MINIMAL, SURGICAL CHANGES required.

70. **QA-36**: Act as an Objective QA Rust developer and rate the work performed on FluentEngine AgentConfig replacement. Verify: (1) All AgentConfig parameters replaced with AgentRole trait objects, (2) Imports updated correctly, (3) Function signatures use proper trait object types, (4) Code compiles without AgentConfig references.

### MILESTONE 6: Move Middleware from Domain to Fluent-AI Package

73. **ARCHITECTURAL**: Create middleware directory structure in fluent-ai
    - **File**: `packages/fluent-ai/src/middleware/`
    - **Implementation**: Create directory structure with modules: `mod.rs`, `command.rs`, `performance.rs`, `security.rs`, `caching.rs`
    - **Architecture**: Middleware belongs in application orchestration layer (fluent-ai) as it handles cross-cutting concerns like performance monitoring, security, caching, and logging - not domain business logic.

    - **Implementation**: Move CommandMiddleware, MiddlewareChain, and related implementations to fluent-ai package. Update imports and module declarations.
    - **Architecture**: Command middleware is service logic that orchestrates domain operations - belongs in application layer, not domain layer.

Rate 1-10 with specific feedback.
