# TODO.md - Typesafe Typestate Engine Builder Implementation

## Phase 1: Fix Core Engine Compilation Issues

### 1. Resolve async trait object safety compilation errors
- Fix async_trait macro usage for trait objects
- Ensure Send + Sync bounds are properly handled  
- Test trait object creation and usage
- Verify engine registry compilation
**DO NOT MOCK, FABRICATE, FAKE or SIMULATE ANY OPERATION or DATA. Make ONLY THE MINIMAL, SURGICAL CHANGES required. Do not modify or rewrite any portion of the app outside scope.**

### 2. Act as an Objective QA Rust developer and rate the work performed on fixing engine trait compilation issues, ensuring async trait object safety is properly implemented and all bounds are correctly specified.

### 3. Validate engine registry functionality
- Test engine registration and retrieval
- Verify default engine setting and getting
- Ensure thread safety of global registry
- Test error handling for missing engines
**DO NOT MOCK, FABRICATE, FAKE or SIMULATE ANY OPERATION or DATA. Make ONLY THE MINIMAL, SURGICAL CHANGES required. Do not modify or rewrite any portion of the app outside scope.**

### 4. Act as an Objective QA Rust developer and rate the work performed on engine registry validation, ensuring thread safety, proper error handling, and correct global state management.

## Phase 2: Typesafe Typestate Engine Builder Design

### 5. Design phantom type states for engine builder
- Create NeedsModel, NeedsConfiguration, Ready states
- Define state transition methods with phantom types
- Ensure compile-time validation of required fields
- Design immutable builder pattern with new instance returns
**DO NOT MOCK, FABRICATE, FAKE or SIMULATE ANY OPERATION or DATA. Make ONLY THE MINIMAL, SURGICAL CHANGES required. Do not modify or rewrite any portion of the app outside scope.**

### 6. Act as an Objective QA Rust developer and rate the work performed on typestate builder design, ensuring proper phantom type usage, compile-time safety, and immutable patterns.

### 7. Implement EngineBuilder core structure
- Create EngineBuilder<State> generic struct
- Implement state marker traits (ModelState, ConfigState, etc.)
- Add phantom type field to builder struct
- Create initial builder constructor method
**DO NOT MOCK, FABRICATE, FAKE or SIMULATE ANY OPERATION or DATA. Make ONLY THE MINIMAL, SURGICAL CHANGES required. Do not modify or rewrite any portion of the app outside scope.**

### 8. Act as an Objective QA Rust developer and rate the work performed on EngineBuilder core implementation, ensuring proper generic constraints and phantom type handling.

### 9. Implement model configuration methods
