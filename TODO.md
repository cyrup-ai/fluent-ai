## MODEL-INFO EXTENSION: Provider-Specific Model Enums without 'Model' Suffix [NEW]

### Objective
Extend the code generation in model-info to create additional enums for each provider, named directly after the provider (e.g., OpenAI instead of OpenaiModel), with variants corresponding to sanitized model names. This enables syntax like OpenAI::Gpt4o for model selection, while maintaining access to model info via trait impls using dynamically fetched data at build time. This directly supports typesafe fluent builders in Fluent-AI, allowing seamless integration into high-level chains (e.g., AgentRoleBuilder::with_model(OpenAI::Gpt4o)).

Research Sources:
- /Volumes/samsung_t9/fluent-ai/packages/model-info/build.rs
- /Volumes/samsung_t9/fluent-ai/packages/model-info/buildlib/codegen.rs
- /Volumes/samsung_t9/fluent-ai/packages/model-info/buildlib/providers/mod.rs
- /Volumes/samsung_t9/fluent-ai/packages/fluent-ai/ARCHITECTURE.md (for fluent builder patterns)
- /Volumes/samsung_t9/fluent-ai/packages/fluent-ai/examples/agent_role_builder.rs (real-world fluent API examples)
- https://docs.rs/syn/latest/syn/ (for codegen best practices)

Architectural Notes:
- Change enum naming in codegen.rs to use customized provider name (e.g., 'OpenAI' for 'openai').
- Adjust sanitization if needed to match desired variant names (e.g., handle dots as underscores).
- Generate additional enums alongside existing ones to avoid breaking changes.
- Ensure trait impls for new enums.
- Update any dependent code in fluent-ai to use new syntax where appropriate.
- Integrate with Fluent-AI's streams-first async: Ensure all generated methods return AsyncStream where appropriate, no Futures.
- Test fluent chaining: e.g., ModelBuilder::provider(OpenAI).model(OpenAI::Gpt4o).with_capabilities(...)

### Tasks

- Task 1: Research and define custom enum names for each provider (e.g., map 'openai' to 'OpenAI'). STATUS: WORKING
- Task 2: Modify codegen.rs to generate additional enum with new name and variants. STATUS: PLANNED
- Task 3: Implement trait impl generation for the new enums. STATUS: PLANNED
- Task 4: Adjust sanitize_ident to optionally use underscores for certain characters if required. STATUS: PLANNED
- Task 5: Update buildlib/mod.rs to include generation of new enums in the output. STATUS: PLANNED
- Task 6: Run cargo check in model-info package to verify changes. STATUS: PLANNED
- Task 7: If compilation succeeds, mark for testing with example builder usage. STATUS: PLANNED
- Task 8 (NEW): Create an example in /Volumes/samsung_t9/fluent-ai/packages/model-info/examples/ demonstrating fluent builder integration (e.g., chaining with generated enums). STATUS: PLANNED
# JSON Syntax Support Implementation

      - Zero-allocation design preservation
      - No exposed macros requirement fulfillment
      - Example compilation success without modifications
      - Edge case handling and error reporting quality

## Architecture Notes for JSON Syntax

- The `{"key" => "value"}` syntax is NOT standard Rust syntax - it's a domain-specific language requiring macro transformation
- Current builder methods expect `Into<hashbrown::HashMap<&'static str, &'static str>>` but lack JSON syntax support
- Existing From implementations at lines 638-675 in agent_role.rs only handle array syntax `[("key", "value")]`
- Solution approach: Create `hash_map_fn!` macro that transforms JSON syntax into array syntax that existing From implementations can handle
- All transformations must be internal to the crate with zero exposed macros to users
- Must preserve zero-allocation builder pattern and blazing-fast performance
