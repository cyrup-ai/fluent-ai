# TODO: Implement Cyrup-Sugars JSON Syntax Integration

## Sequential Thinking Plan

Based on the JSON_SYNTAX.md implementation guide, this plan integrates existing cyrup_sugars library with hashbrown-json features to enable `{"key" => "value"}` syntax in fluent-ai builder patterns.

## Phase 1: Add Cyrup-Sugars Dependency

### 1. Add cyrup_sugars dependency to packages/fluent-ai/Cargo.toml
**File:** `packages/fluent-ai/Cargo.toml`  
**Implementation Notes:**
- Add exact dependency from JSON_SYNTAX.md: `cyrup_sugars = { git = "https://github.com/cyrup-ai/cyrup-sugars", package = "cyrup_sugars", branch = "main", features = ["hashbrown-json"] }`
- Add `hashbrown = "0.14"` dependency as required by the guide
- Run `cargo hakari generate && cargo hakari manage-deps` to update workspace dependencies

**Architecture Notes:**
- The hashbrown-json feature enables automatic transformation of `{"key" => "value"}` syntax
- The transformation system works at compile-time without exposing macros to users
- Dependencies must be configured before builder method updates

**DO NOT MOCK, FABRICATE, FAKE or SIMULATE ANY OPERATION or DATA. Make ONLY THE MINIMAL, SURGICAL CHANGES required. Do not modify or rewrite any portion of the app outside scope.**

### 2. QA: Act as an Objective QA Rust developer and rate the cyrup_sugars dependency addition on a scale of 1-10. Verify the dependency uses the exact git URL and features from the JSON_SYNTAX.md guide and hakari is updated correctly.

## Phase 2: Update Builder Method Signatures

### 3. Update AgentRoleBuilder.additional_params method
**File:** `packages/fluent-ai/src/domain/agent_role.rs`  
**Line Numbers:** Find the `additional_params` method (approximately line 100-150)  
**Implementation Notes:**
- Change method signature from current to: `pub fn additional_params<P>(mut self, params: P) -> Self where P: Into<hashbrown::HashMap<&'static str, &'static str>>`
- Update method implementation to call `let config_map = params.into();` and convert to internal HashMap format
- Add proper error handling without unwrap() or expect()
- Follow exact pattern from JSON_SYNTAX.md guide lines 218-231

**Architecture Notes:**
- Generic parameters enable automatic transformation of JSON syntax
- The Into trait bound allows cyrup_sugars to provide HashMap implementations
- Method must handle conversion from hashbrown::HashMap to internal format

**DO NOT MOCK, FABRICATE, FAKE or SIMULATE ANY OPERATION or DATA. Make ONLY THE MINIMAL, SURGICAL CHANGES required. Do not modify or rewrite any portion of the app outside scope.**

### 4. QA: Act as an Objective QA Rust developer and rate the additional_params method update on a scale of 1-10. Verify it uses generic parameters exactly as specified in the JSON_SYNTAX.md guide and handles the conversion correctly.

### 5. Update AgentRoleBuilder.metadata method
**File:** `packages/fluent-ai/src/domain/agent_role.rs`  
**Line Numbers:** Find the `metadata` method (approximately line 150-200)  
**Implementation Notes:**
- Change method signature from current to: `pub fn metadata<P>(mut self, metadata: P) -> Self where P: Into<hashbrown::HashMap<&'static str, &'static str>>`
- Update method implementation to call `let config_map = metadata.into();` and convert to internal HashMap format
- Add proper error handling without unwrap() or expect()
- Follow exact pattern from JSON_SYNTAX.md guide lines 233-246

**Architecture Notes:**
- Metadata method follows same pattern as additional_params
- Must handle multiple key-value pairs: `{"key" => "val", "foo" => "bar"}`
- Internal storage format may differ from hashbrown::HashMap

**DO NOT MOCK, FABRICATE, FAKE or SIMULATE ANY OPERATION or DATA. Make ONLY THE MINIMAL, SURGICAL CHANGES required. Do not modify or rewrite any portion of the app outside scope.**

### 6. QA: Act as an Objective QA Rust developer and rate the metadata method update on a scale of 1-10. Verify it uses generic parameters exactly as specified in the JSON_SYNTAX.md guide and handles the conversion correctly.

### 7. Update Tool::new method
**File:** `packages/fluent-ai/src/domain/tool_v2.rs`  
**Line Numbers:** Find the `Tool::new` method (approximately line 50-100)  
**Implementation Notes:**
- Change method signature from current to: `pub fn new<P>(params: P) -> Tool<T> where P: Into<hashbrown::HashMap<&'static str, &'static str>>`
- Update method implementation to call `let _config_map = params.into();` and store/use the parameters
- Add proper error handling without unwrap() or expect()
- Follow exact pattern from JSON_SYNTAX.md guide lines 252-261

**Architecture Notes:**
- Tool::new must accept JSON syntax for patterns like `Tool::<Perplexity>::new({"citations" => "true"})`
- The method creates Tool instances with configuration parameters
- Generic type parameter T represents the tool type (e.g., Perplexity)

**DO NOT MOCK, FABRICATE, FAKE or SIMULATE ANY OPERATION or DATA. Make ONLY THE MINIMAL, SURGICAL CHANGES required. Do not modify or rewrite any portion of the app outside scope.**

### 8. QA: Act as an Objective QA Rust developer and rate the Tool::new method update on a scale of 1-10. Verify it uses generic parameters exactly as specified in the JSON_SYNTAX.md guide and accepts the hashbrown HashMap correctly.

## Phase 3: Configure Re-exports and Features

### 9. Add hashbrown-json feature to packages/fluent-ai/Cargo.toml
**File:** `packages/fluent-ai/Cargo.toml`  
**Line Numbers:** Add to `[features]` section (create if doesn't exist)  
**Implementation Notes:**
- Add `[features]` section with `hashbrown-json = []` feature gate as shown in JSON_SYNTAX.md guide lines 85-87
- Ensure the feature is properly configured for the transformation system

**Architecture Notes:**
- Feature gates control compilation of JSON syntax transformation code
- The hashbrown-json feature enables the automatic transformation system
- Must be configured before the transformation system can work

**DO NOT MOCK, FABRICATE, FAKE or SIMULATE ANY OPERATION or DATA. Make ONLY THE MINIMAL, SURGICAL CHANGES required. Do not modify or rewrite any portion of the app outside scope.**

### 10. QA: Act as an Objective QA Rust developer and rate the feature configuration on a scale of 1-10. Verify the hashbrown-json feature is properly configured as specified in the guide.

### 11. Update packages/fluent-ai/src/prelude.rs to include hashbrown re-export
**File:** `packages/fluent-ai/src/prelude.rs`  
**Line Numbers:** Add to existing re-exports section  
**Implementation Notes:**
- Add `pub use hashbrown::HashMap;` to make hashbrown available through prelude
- Ensure the transformation system can access hashbrown types

**Architecture Notes:**
- The prelude provides convenient access to commonly used types
- hashbrown re-export ensures transformation system has access to HashMap types
- Users should be able to use JSON syntax without additional imports

**DO NOT MOCK, FABRICATE, FAKE or SIMULATE ANY OPERATION or DATA. Make ONLY THE MINIMAL, SURGICAL CHANGES required. Do not modify or rewrite any portion of the app outside scope.**

### 12. QA: Act as an Objective QA Rust developer and rate the prelude updates on a scale of 1-10. Verify hashbrown is properly re-exported for the transformation system.

## Phase 4: Test Integration

### 13. Test chat_loop_example.rs compilation
**File:** `packages/fluent-ai/examples/chat_loop_example.rs`  
**Implementation Notes:**
- Run `cargo check -p fluent-ai` to ensure the example compiles with 0 errors, 0 warnings
- Verify the JSON syntax `{"key" => "value"}` works automatically without any macro imports
- Check that the transformation system handles the syntax correctly

**Architecture Notes:**
- The example demonstrates real-world usage of JSON syntax
- Compilation success proves the transformation system works correctly
- No macro imports should be required in user code

**DO NOT MOCK, FABRICATE, FAKE or SIMULATE ANY OPERATION or DATA. Make ONLY THE MINIMAL, SURGICAL CHANGES required. Do not modify or rewrite any portion of the app outside scope.**

### 14. QA: Act as an Objective QA Rust developer and rate the compilation test on a scale of 1-10. Verify the chat_loop_example.rs compiles successfully with the JSON syntax working automatically.

### 15. Create integration test in packages/fluent-ai/tests/cyrup_sugars_json_test.rs
**File:** `packages/fluent-ai/tests/cyrup_sugars_json_test.rs` (new file)  
**Implementation Notes:**
- Test the JSON syntax patterns from the guide: `{"beta" => "true"}`, `{"key" => "val", "foo" => "bar"}`, `{"citations" => "true"}`
- Verify the transformation system works correctly with cyrup_sugars
- Test builder method calls with JSON syntax
- Use expect() in tests but never unwrap()

**Architecture Notes:**
- Integration tests verify end-to-end functionality
- Tests should cover all JSON syntax patterns used in the example
- Tests validate that the transformation produces correct HashMap instances

**DO NOT MOCK, FABRICATE, FAKE or SIMULATE ANY OPERATION or DATA. Make ONLY THE MINIMAL, SURGICAL CHANGES required. Do not modify or rewrite any portion of the app outside scope.**

### 16. QA: Act as an Objective QA Rust developer and rate the integration test on a scale of 1-10. Verify it properly tests the JSON syntax with cyrup_sugars transformation system.

## Phase 5: Clean Up and Verification

### 17. Remove unused cyrup-sugars-template directory
**File:** `packages/fluent-ai/cyrup-sugars-template/` (directory removal)  
**Implementation Notes:**
- Delete packages/fluent-ai/cyrup-sugars-template/ since we're using the real cyrup_sugars dependency
- Clean up any references to the template in documentation or imports

**Architecture Notes:**
- The template directory was for development/testing purposes
- Using the real cyrup_sugars dependency eliminates need for template code
- Cleanup reduces maintenance burden and confusion

**DO NOT MOCK, FABRICATE, FAKE or SIMULATE ANY OPERATION or DATA. Make ONLY THE MINIMAL, SURGICAL CHANGES required. Do not modify or rewrite any portion of the app outside scope.**

### 18. QA: Act as an Objective QA Rust developer and rate the cleanup on a scale of 1-10. Verify the template directory is properly removed and no references remain.

### 19. Run full workspace compilation verification
**Implementation Notes:**
- Execute `cargo check` across entire workspace to ensure 0 errors, 0 warnings
- Verify no regressions in existing functionality
- Test that hakari dependencies are still properly managed
- Confirm the JSON syntax works seamlessly across all builder patterns

**Architecture Notes:**
- Full workspace verification ensures no regressions
- All packages must compile successfully with the new dependency
- Hakari dependency management must remain functional
- JSON syntax should work consistently across all builders

**DO NOT MOCK, FABRICATE, FAKE or SIMULATE ANY OPERATION or DATA. Make ONLY THE MINIMAL, SURGICAL CHANGES required. Do not modify or rewrite any portion of the app outside scope.**

### 20. QA: Act as an Objective QA Rust developer and rate the full workspace verification on a scale of 1-10. Verify no regressions exist and the JSON syntax works correctly across the entire workspace.

### 21. Execute chat_loop_example.rs to verify runtime functionality
**File:** `packages/fluent-ai/examples/chat_loop_example.rs`  
**Implementation Notes:**
- Run `cargo run --example chat_loop_example` to ensure the example executes successfully
- Verify the JSON syntax patterns work at runtime, not just compilation
- Check that the transformation system produces correct hashbrown HashMap instances
- Ensure no runtime panics or errors occur

**Architecture Notes:**
- Runtime testing validates the complete integration
- JSON syntax must produce correct HashMap instances at runtime
- The example should execute without errors or panics
- Transformation system must work correctly in production environment

**DO NOT MOCK, FABRICATE, FAKE or SIMULATE ANY OPERATION or DATA. Make ONLY THE MINIMAL, SURGICAL CHANGES required. Do not modify or rewrite any portion of the app outside scope.**

### 22. QA: Act as an Objective QA Rust developer and rate the runtime functionality test on a scale of 1-10. Verify the example runs successfully and the JSON syntax produces correct HashMap instances at runtime.
