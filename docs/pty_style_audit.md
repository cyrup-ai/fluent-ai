# PTY Style Audit

| Component        | File                       | Issues                                                                 |
|------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Command Prompt   | `command_prompt.rs`        | Uses hardcoded color values from the Dracula theme. Possible duplication in color declarations. |
| Configurations   | `config.rs`                | Centralized style management but potential complexity in managing nested HashMap for styles. |
| Textarea Prompt  | `textarea_prompt_style.rs` | Trait for managing style but relies heavily on internal implementations. Limited extensibility. |
| Screen           | `screen.rs`                | Uses color conversions between `vt100::Color` and `Color`, creating complexity. |
| Help View        | `help_view.rs`             | Uses locally declared colors, risking inconsistency with other components. |

## General Observations
- **Duplicated Styles:** Several components define their own color constants, leading to duplication.
- **Hardcoded Colors:** Colors are often hardcoded. Central styling could improve maintainability.
- **Component Boundaries:** Components manage their own styles, which can be centrally encapsulated.

## Recommendations
1. **Centralize Styles:** Create a shared style module to define and manage styles and colors.
2. **Reduce Hardcoding:** Refactor components to use centralized styles to avoid color duplication and hardcoding.
3. **Enhance Config:** Simplify the styling configuration where possible to reduce complexity from nested HashMaps.
